# miscWeb3work
This is for web3 related work that does not primarily fit into other organizations to which I contribute.  

For example, simple analysis for Gitcoin DAO or documents written that could be useful for other builders.  

There must be a better way to use Github for these purposes, such as integrating HackMD however that isn't clean either.
